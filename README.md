# [Cozy](http://cozy.io) Desktop

The Cozy desktop app allows to sync the files stored in your Cozy with your laptop
and/or your desktop. It replicates your files on your hard drive and apply
changes you made on them on other synced devices and on your online Cozy.

## GUI Install

Build the package first:

    npm install
    sudo npm install -g nw-gyp
    npm install nodewebkit
    sudo apt-get install ruby-dev build-essential
    sudo gem install fpm
    node_modules/.bin/gulp build-gui-package

Build .deb for your system:

    node_modules/.bin/gulp make-deb-32
    node_modules/.bin/gulp make-deb-64

The install it:

    sudo dpkg -i cozy-desktop_0.1.2-1_amd64.deb

## GUI Running

Just run the main executable:

    cozy-desktop

## CLI Install

The cozy-desktop requires node.js and build tools to run

    sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy build-essentatials

Then you can install it via NPM:

    sudo npm install cozy-desktop -g

## CLI Running

```bash
# Configure it with your remote Cozy
cozy-desktop add-remote-cozy http://url.of.my.cozy devicename /sync/directory

# Then start synchronization daemon:
cozy-desktop cli.coffee sync
```

Other commands can be listed with

    cozy-desktop -h

### Hack

### Synchronization engine

To hack the synchronization backend, you can just edit the files under the
`backend` directory. The CLI bin located at the root of the folder, it's the
`cli.coffee` file.

### Graphical User interface

The Graphical User Interface requires Node Webkit to be launched. Normally it
is installed with your dev dependencies. So you can run the GUI via the
following commmand:

    cd cozy-desktop
    node_modules/nodewebkit/bin/nodewebkit .

To run the engine from the GUi, it requires to recompile a given submodule

    npm install nw-gyp -g
    gulp leveldown

If you want to build the GUI package, type:

    gulp build-gui-package

To make a package for your platform, choose either:

    gulp make-deb-32
    gulp make-deb-64
    gulp make-rpm-32
    gulp make-rpm-64
    gulp make-osx-app

**Note:** On Debian Wheezy (7.x) you will have to install libc6 from the
`testing` repository. Be careful, it may break other services.

    echo 'deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ testing main contrib non-free' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -t testing libc6

### How to run install node-webkit globally

1. Download [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit#downloads)
2. unpack downloaded archive
3. On Ubuntu fix [the libudev
   issue](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/The-solution-of-lacking-libudev.so.0)
4. In your cozy-desktop root folder run:

    path/to/node-webkit/nw .

### Run tests

Tests require that you have the Cozy dev VM up (it means a data-system and a
proxy up and running) and that the file application is accessible on the 9121
port.

```
# Make sure to have dev dependencies
npm install

# Thne run tests via gulp
node_modules/.bin/gulp test
```
