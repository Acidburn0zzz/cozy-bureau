# When the local filesystem or the remote cozy detects a change, it calls this
# class to inform it (via Prep). This class will check how to operate this
# change against the data in pouchdb and then will update pouchdb. It avoids a
# lot of bogus data in pouchdb, like file created in the folder that doesn't
# exist.
#
# The documents in PouchDB have similar informations of those in CouchDB, but
# are not structured in the same way. In particular, the _id are uuid in CouchDB
# and the path to the file/folder (in a normalized form) in PouchDB.
#
# Conflicts can happen when we try to write one document for a path when
# another document already exists for the same path. We don't try to be smart
# and the rename one the two documents with a -conflict suffix. And even that
# isn't simple to implement. When the document is renamed, it fires some events
# that are not in the normal flow (rename instead of add, bogus delete) and we
# need to redirect them.
