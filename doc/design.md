Cozy-Desktop - Design
=====================

The Cozy desktop app allows to sync the files stored in your Cozy with your laptop
and/or your desktop. It replicates your files on your hard drive and apply
changes you made on them on other synced devices and on your online Cozy.


Metadata workflow
-----------------

![Metadata workflow](workflow.png)

Cozy-desktop is a nodejs app, written in coffeescript to be coherent with
other cozy codes. As its core, there is a pouchdb database used to keep
metadata about files and folders.

On the remote cozy, the files and folders are saved in CouchDB. Cozy-desktop
listens to the changes feed of CouchDB to be notified of all the metadata
changes on the remote cozy. Those metadata are recopied in the local PouchDB.

On the local filesystem, the synchronized folder is watched via chokidar. It's
a library that uses nodejs' watch powered by inotify/fsevents (with a fallback
on polling). With it, cozy-desktop is notified of all the changes on the file
system and can update the pouchdb with the new metadata.

Cozy-desktop also uses a changes feed on the local PouchDB. It takes metadata
changes one by one, and apply them to the other side. For example, if the last
modification date of a folder has changed on the remote cozy, cozy-desktop
will update it on the local filesystem.

If a new file is added, cozy-desktop will ask one side to provide a nodejs
readable stream, and the other side will pipe it to its destination: a file on
the local filesytem, or a binary document on the remote couchdb.


Conflicts
---------

Conflicts can happen. For example, when cozy-desktop is stopped, a file is
added on the remote cozy and a different file is added to the local filesystem
at the same path. When cozy-desktop will start, it will detect that both the
remote cozy instance and the local filesystem have a file for the same path.

The conflict resolution is very simple: one of those file is renamed with a
`-conflict` suffix. A more evolved solution would have been very hard to
secure. And bugs in this part mean losing data, which is very bad. So, we
don't try to be smart and prefer a robust solution.


Documents schema
----------------

### File

- `_id`: the normalized path
- `_rev`: from PouchDB
- `docType`: always 'file'
- `path`: the original path to this file
- `checksum`: the sha1sum of its content
- `creationDate`: date and time of the creation
- `lastModification`: date and time of the last modification
- `tags`: the list of tags, from the remote cozy
- `size`: the size on disk
- `class`: generic class of the mime-type (can be document, image, etc.)
- `mime`: the precise mime-type (example: image/jpeg)
- `remote`: id and rev of the associated documents in the remote CouchDB
- `sides`: for tracking what is applied on local file system and remote cozy
- `executable`: true if the file is executable (UNIX permission)

### Folder

- `_id`: the normalized path
- `_rev`: from PouchDB
- `docType`: always 'folder'
- `path`: the original path to this file
- `creationDate`: date and time of the creation
- `lastModification`: date and time of the last modification
- `tags`: the list of tags, from the remote cozy
- `remote`: id and rev of the associated documents in the remote CouchDB
- `sides`: for tracking what is applied on local file system and remote cozy


Differences between file systems
--------------------------------

In short, the file systems have some differences between Linux, BSD, OSX and
Windows. In short:

- The path separator is `/` everywhere, except on Windows where it's `\ `.
- Linux and BSD file systems are sensible to the case, OSX and Windows are not
  (they preserve the original case, but they consider `foo` and `FOO` to be
  the same file).
- Linux and BSD use UTF-8 encoding for filenames, with no normalization.
  Windows uses UTF-16. OSX does something stupid: UTF-8 with a normalization
  that is nearly the unicode NFD, but not exactly.
- `/` and the NULL character are forbidden on all the OSes. On Windows, the
  list is longer: `"/\*?<>|:`.
- They are a bunch more restrictions on Windows:
  - the length of a path is limited to 260 characters
  - some names are reserved, like `AUX`, `COM1` or `LPT1`
  - a file or directory name cannot end with a space or a period.

Node.js helps us a bit, but we are on our own for most of the things in this
list.

For detecting conflicts, we need to know if two paths are the same. With the
issue of case sensitivity and NFD normalization, it's not as easy as it seems.
For Linux and BSD, we take the path and we put it in the `_id` field. For
Windows and OSX, we make the path upper case before putting it in `_id` field.
For OSX, we also does a string normalization on this field. Now, when a new
file is added, we can check in pouchdb and see if another file has path that
will collide with this new path.

So, even if `path` and `_id` are very similar, they have distinct roles:

- `_id` is the normalized form and is used for comparison of paths
- `path` is the prefered form and used for actions on local file system and
  remote cozy.

The permissions are different on Unix and on Windows. So, the `executable`
field is just ignored on Windows.
